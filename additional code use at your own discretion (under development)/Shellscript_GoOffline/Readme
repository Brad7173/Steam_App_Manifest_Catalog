Basic shellscript for more paranoid steam users who are determined not to be forced to update games. (I only have a mobile hotspot for internet and each 5gb data addon cost $11.86)
Wonder how steam knows there are updates when it's not even open?? Check your processes and do a search for steam and you will also notice a steam service.
