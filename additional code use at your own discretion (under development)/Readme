#1 DO NOT PUT THESE SCRIPTS INTO YOUR STEAM FOLDER!! These are to go into a different folder!!

(1) You need to create a directory in your home folder named "SteamBackup".
(2) Inisde of it create a directory named "AppManifest".
(3) Inside of it create a directory named "Original".
(4) Locate your steam folder containing your app manifest files. (I use Kubuntu 22.04 LTS and mine is located at "/home/username/.steam/root/steamapps/" username would be your username for your os.
(5) Copy all of your app manifest files into the folder you created "/home/username/SteamBackup/AppManifest/Original/".
(6) You can also place the Active_Steam_Appmanifest_Catalog.sh file into the same directory.
(7) Place the Appmanifest_Mod.sh and the Backed_Up_Steam_Appmanifest_Catalog.sh files into the "/home/username/SteamBackup/" directory.

.sh files are shellscript files and can be clicked then right clicked in kde and ran in konsole (each os is different as for what terminal it uses)
You can also cd into the directory containing .sh files and launch them by typing ./shellscriptname.sh

If you select your steam directory and modify your non duplicated app manifest files you do so at your own discretion. 
Keep in mind if you do this correctly it will create .bak files of the ones you copied into the "Original" directory. (.bak files can be renamed to .acf)
